# AutoSubtasks
Kanboard Plugin to create Automatic Actions for subtasks.
This Automatic Action will allow you to add a subtask when the task is moved to another column or upon Task creation within a column. 


# Install
Create a directory **AutomaticAction** under the folder **plugins**
- Copy all source files in this new directory.

# Requirements
Since this adds a due date to the subtask, you may need to also have Subtask Due Date Plugin installed as well.
